<i id="bulb" class="far fa-lightbulb fa-3x"></i>

<h1>
  <span style="color: var(--light-gray)">Dark theme</span>
  /
  <span style="color: var(--dark-gray)">Light theme</span>
</h1>
<button id="nmode">Turn on the light</button>

<p>
  I got the idea of toggling between a dark theme and a light theme by 'turning on the light' while I was working on my blog and contemplating about which theme to choose.

The discussion about what's better, light or dark, is as old as the internet itself, and this 'bulb' looks like a nice compromising solution.
